    "Fourth is to clean the data. Cleaning the data may include imputing missing values, removing outliers, standardizing the keywords or headers, conversions to proper datatypes etc.\n",
    "Fifth step would be to perform an exploratory data analysis to find the key details that would later help in our modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is a process by which the explanatory features are transformed and elevated to a lower dimension. It is also the process by which the irrelevant features are removed. Several machine learning algorithms are highly negatively affected by high dimensionality, due to which this process becomes very important."

Quantitative data exploration requires numbers recieved from observation and experiment. Qualitative data exploration is different as most of it hinges on frequency table to formulate observations."

Other non linear relationships like quadratic or trigonometric relations can also be approximated and identified visually between two variables. Outliers can also be found using scatter plots."

Several tests like the chi square test can help find relations based on the cross tab."
