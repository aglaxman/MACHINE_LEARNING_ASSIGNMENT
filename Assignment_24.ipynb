    "8. What is a Gaussian mixture, and how does it work? What are some of the things you can do about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. Gaussian Mixture models are used for representing Normally Distributed subpopulations within an overall population. The advantage of Mixture models is that they do not require which subpopulation a data point belongs to. It allows the model to learn the subpopulations automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. When using a Gaussian mixture model, can you name two techniques for determining the correct number of clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can a Gaussian mixture model be used for clustering? Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are often used for data clustering. You can use GMMs to perform either hard clustering or soft clustering on query data. To perform hard clustering, the GMM assigns query data points to the multivariate normal components that maximize the component posterior probability, given the data."
